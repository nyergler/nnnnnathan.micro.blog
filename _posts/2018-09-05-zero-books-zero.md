Thorsten writes [about the tools](https://thorstenball.com/blog/2018/09/04/the-tools-i-use-to-write-books/) he used to write two books; spoiler: a text editor features prominently, custom tools do not.

I've definitely let my desire to [“keep it DRY”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) interfere with this while attempting to [update Effective Django](https://beta.effectivedjango.com/); Sphinx’s `literalinclude` has a [pyobject](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html#directive-literalinclude) option, which I've taken more than one stab at extending to show "book-style" diffs. (Not dwelling on the fact that -- for Effective Django, at least -- I’d also need to write the equivalent for at least HTML.)

Perhaps unsurprisingly, for Thorsten it comes down to _writing_.

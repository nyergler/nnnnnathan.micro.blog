Talking to my grandparents this week, they expressed how valuable they find Facebook for feeling connected to their increasingly geographically-spread family. Reminded me that there is a valuable, relationship-affirming side of social media tools that exists in tension with the [increasingly distressing](http://calnewport.com/blog/2018/02/09/facebooks-desperate-smoke-screen/) aspects of the attention economy.

Although that may simply be because the algorithms haven't caught up with nonagenarians [yet].

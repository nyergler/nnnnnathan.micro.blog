Open source maintainer burnout is a real thing; _and_ Hapi’s ["backwards commercial” license plan](https://hueniverse.com/the-backwards-commercial-license-647290f7e38b) leaves me with a bad taste. 

> 80% of current hapi users are on an older major version than master.

From the latest [major version release notes](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi/issues/3658):

> hapi v17.0.0 is a major new version of the framework. … In many ways, it is a new framework because it make fundamental changes to how business logic is interfaced with the framework.

Maybe this has something to do with the number of users who haven't upgraded? (We use Hapi at work and currently sponsor the project; after looking at v17, I can't imagine why we'd invest the time to upgrade to what is effectively a different framework.)

Back from a week of #printmaking in #santafe with @anniebissettartist and studio dog Twiggy. Learned about #mokuhanga -- Japanese wood block printing -- and worked with water based inks more intentionally than I have in the past. Lots of new avenues  for my print work going forward. 
This five block print is based on a photo I took in Guernsey a couple years ago while traveling with [@matt](https://micro.blog/matt).pincus and @artextorian. Loved the vegetation, stairs, and pallette of that island.
